        The origin of the domestic dog is not 
        clear. It is known that the dog was the 
        first domesticated species.[13][15] The 
         domestic dog is a member of the genus Canis
        (canines), which forms part of the wolf-like
        canids,[5] and is the most widely abundant 
        terrestrial carnivore.[6][7][8][9][10] The 
        closest living relative of the dog is the 
        gray wolf and there is no evidence of any
        other canine contributing to its genetic
        lineage.[7][8][23][11] The dog and the 
        extant gray wolf form two sister clades,
        [11][12][13] with modern wolves not closely
        related to the wolves that were first 
        domesticated.[12][13] The archaeological 
        record shows the first undisputed dog remains
        beside humans 14,700 years ago,[24] with 
        disputed remains occurring 36,000 years ago
        .[25] These dates imply that the earliest dogs
        arose in the time of human hunter-gatherers 
        and not at the dawn of agriculture.
